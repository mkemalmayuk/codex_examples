## Linear Regression Example

This repository includes a small script demonstrating how to perform a
multiple linear regression in pure Python without external dependencies.
The example fits a plane ``z = a*x + b*y + c`` and prints the slopes and

coefficient of determination (R^2). The script reads its data from
``fund_data.csv`` which is included in this repository.
Run it with:

```bash
python3 linear_regression_example.py
```

The repository also includes `print_csv.py` which simply prints the raw CSV data:

```bash
python3 print_csv.py
```

coefficient of determination (R^2).
Run it with:


```bash
python3 linear_regression_example.py
```
