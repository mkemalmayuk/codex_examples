## Linear Regression Example

This repository includes a small script demonstrating how to perform a
multiple linear regression in pure Python without external dependencies.
The example fits a plane ``z = a*x + b*y + c`` and prints the slopes and
coefficient of determination (R^2).
Run it with:

```bash
python3 linear_regression_example.py
```
